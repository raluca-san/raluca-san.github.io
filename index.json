I then applied machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, k-means, PCA) and evaluated their classification performance through different metrics. We obtained the best classification performance with the Random Forests model. We observed that adding a four-level Gaussian Pyramid to the feature space enhances greatly the classification performance, from approximately 81% to 96% correctly classified for the positive class.

Each year, there are about 850,000  cases of primary liver cancer worldwide. Although surgical resection still is the gold  standard for most cases, only 20–30% of patients are candidates for it, due to the  advanced stage of the disease. Surgery can also be a huge burden to the patient and  his/her quality of life might be temporarily severely reduced due to long hospital  stays, complications, and slow recovery. To overcome these disadvantages, thermo- ablation of tumors of up to 3 cm has become a more viable alternative especially in the  last decade, offering a potentially equally effective but minimally invasive and tissue  sparing treatment alternative. In conjunction with improved CT imaging, stereotactic  image-guidance techniques and image fusion technology were introduced to increase  safety, efficacy, and accuracy of this treatment. Stereotactic image-guidance leads to a  simple, fast, and accurate placement of the ablation probe into the liver tumor, which  is a prerequisite for a complete destruction of the tumor by ablation. More and more  physicians, including surgeons, consider ablation a viable alternative to resection  whenever feasible. Patients undergoing such a minimally invasive treatment benefit  from a shorter hospital stays, reduced complication rates, and faster recovery.","tags":null,"title":"Stereotactic Image-Guidance  for Ablation of Malignant Liver  Tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raluca-Maria Sandu","Iwan Paolucci","Jacob Freedman","Stefan Weber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"365902a9f162bc2b126edaaf5f915b80","permalink":"https://raluca-san.github.io/publication/sandu-quantitative-2019-1/","publishdate":"2020-01-08T19:01:07.39748Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sandu-quantitative-2019-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Thermal ablations are becoming an increasingly common alternative treatment to surgery in patients with primary  and  secondary  hepatic  tumors.

This makes it difficult to achieve negative resection margins (R0) and still preserve as much healthy liver tissue as possible. Even though image-guided surgery systems have been introduced to overcome this challenge, they are still rarely used due to their inaccuracy, time-effort and complexity in usage and setup. We have developed a novel approach, which allows us to create an intra-operative resection plan using navigated ultrasound. First, the surface is scanned using a navigated ultrasound, followed by tumor segmentation on a midsection ultrasound image. Based on this information, the navigation system calculates an optimal resection strategy and displays it along with the tracked surgical instruments. In this study, this approach was evaluated by three experienced hepatobiliary surgeons on ex-vivo porcine models. Using this technique, an R0 resection could be achieved in 22 out of 23 (95.7% R0 resection rate) cases with a median resection margin of 5.9 mm (IQR 3.5 – 7.7 mm). The resection margin between operators 1,2 and 3 was 7.8 mm, 4.15 mm and 5.1 mm respectively (p = 0.054). This approach could represent a useful tool for intra-operative guidance in non-anatomical resection alongside conventional ultrasound guidance. However, instructions and training are essential especially if the operator has not used an image-guidance system before.","tags":["Computer-assisted surgery","Liver neoplasms","Resection techniques","Ultrasonography"],"title":"Ultrasound based planning and navigation for non anatomical liver resections — an ex-vivo study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Radek Hrabuska","Raluca- Maria Sandu","Iwan Paulocci","Stefan Weber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535760000,"objectID":"62f4fa55cd0bcfed6fe204b09fd4be4d","permalink":"https://raluca-san.github.io/publication/hrabuska-framework-2018/","publishdate":"2020-01-08T19:01:07.382457Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hrabuska-framework-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"In recent years, percutaneous ablations of hepatic lesions are becoming a viable alternative to liver resection.
