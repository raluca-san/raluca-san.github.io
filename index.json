Evaluation of ablation completeness is commonly performed by visual inspection in 2D and is prone to inter-reader variability. This work aimed to introduce a standardized approach for evaluation of ablation completeness after CT-guided thermal ablation of liver tumours, using volumetric quantitative ablation margins (QAM).  **Methods**: A QAM computation metric based on volumetric segmentations of tumour and ablation areas and signed Euclidean surface distance maps was developed, including a novel algorithm to address QAM computation in subcapsular tumours. The code for QAM computation was verified in artificial examples of tumour and ablation spheres simulating varying scenarios of ablation margins. The applicability of the QAM metric was investigated in representative cases extracted from a prospective database of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) treated with stereotactic microwave ablation (SMWA).  **Results**: Applicability of the proposed QAM metric was confirmed in synthesized and clinical example cases. Numerical and visual options of data presentation displaying substrata of QAM distributions were proposed. For subcapsular tumours, the underestimation of tumour coverage by the ablation volume when applying an unadjusted QAM method was confirmed, supporting the benefits of using the proposed algorithm for QAM computation in these cases. The computational code for developed QAM was made publicly available, encouraging the use of a standard and objective metric in reporting ablation completeness and margins.  **Conclusion**: The proposed volumetric approach for QAM computation including a novel algorithm to address subcapsular liver tumours enables precision and reproducibility in the assessment of ablation margins. The quantitative feedback on ablation completeness opens possibilities for intra-operative decision making and for refined analyses on predictability and consistency of local tumour control after thermal ablation of liver tumours.","tags":[],"title":"Volumetric Quantitative Ablation Margins for Assessment of Ablation Completeness in Thermal Ablation of Liver Tumours","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Stillström","Raluca Maria Sandu","Jacob Freedman"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609685144,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609685144,"objectID":"e8e54848a1f7fcfd822a8bd3e9642f43","permalink":"https://raluca-san.github.io/publication/stillstrom-2021/","publishdate":"2021-02-03T15:45:44+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/stillstrom-2021/","section":"publication","summary":" Evaluate the accuracy of multiple electrode placements in IRE treatment of liver tumours using a stereotactic CT-based navigation system.

Forty-six per cent were hepatocellular carcinoma, and 36% were colorectal liver metastases. The tumours were located in all segments of the liver. Data were complete from 51 treatments. Two hundred and six electrodes and 336 electrode pairs were analysed. The median lateral and angular error, comparing planned and validated electrode placement, was 3.6 mm (range 0.2–13.6 mm) and 3.1° (range 0°–16.1°). All electrodes with a lateral error 10 mm were either re-positioned or excluded before treatment. The median angle between the electrode pairs was 3.8° (range 0.3°–17.2°). There were no electrode placement-related complications.

This makes it difficult to achieve negative resection margins (R0) and still preserve as much healthy liver tissue as possible. Even though image-guided surgery systems have been introduced to overcome this challenge, they are still rarely used due to their inaccuracy, time-effort and complexity in usage and setup. We have developed a novel approach, which allows us to create an intra-operative resection plan using navigated ultrasound. First, the surface is scanned using a navigated ultrasound, followed by tumor segmentation on a midsection ultrasound image. Based on this information, the navigation system calculates an optimal resection strategy and displays it along with the tracked surgical instruments. In this study, this approach was evaluated by three experienced hepatobiliary surgeons on ex-vivo porcine models. Using this technique, an R0 resection could be achieved in 22 out of 23 (95.7% R0 resection rate) cases with a median resection margin of 5.9 mm (IQR 3.5 – 7.7 mm). The resection margin between operators 1,2 and 3 was 7.8 mm, 4.15 mm and 5.1 mm respectively (p = 0.054). This approach could represent a useful tool for intra-operative guidance in non-anatomical resection alongside conventional ultrasound guidance. However, instructions and training are essential especially if the operator has not used an image-guidance system before.","tags":["Computer-assisted surgery","Liver neoplasms","Resection techniques","Ultrasonography"],"title":"Ultrasound based planning and navigation for non anatomical liver resections — an ex-vivo study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.M.

Each year, there are about 850,000  cases of primary liver cancer worldwide. Although surgical resection still is the gold  standard for most cases, only 20–30% of patients are candidates for it, due to the  advanced stage of the disease. Surgery can also be a huge burden to the patient and  his/her quality of life might be temporarily severely reduced due to long hospital  stays, complications, and slow recovery. To overcome these disadvantages, thermo- ablation of tumors of up to 3 cm has become a more viable alternative especially in the  last decade, offering a potentially equally effective but minimally invasive and tissue  sparing treatment alternative. In conjunction with improved CT imaging, stereotactic  image-guidance techniques and image fusion technology were introduced to increase  safety, efficacy, and accuracy of this treatment. Stereotactic image-guidance leads to a  simple, fast, and accurate placement of the ablation probe into the liver tumor, which  is a prerequisite for a complete destruction of the tumor by ablation. More and more  physicians, including surgeons, consider ablation a viable alternative to resection  whenever feasible. Patients undergoing such a minimally invasive treatment benefit  from a shorter hospital stays, reduced complication rates, and faster recovery.","tags":null,"title":"Stereotactic Image-Guidance  for Ablation of Malignant Liver  Tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raluca-Maria Sandu","Iwan Paolucci","Jacob Freedman","Stefan Weber"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"365902a9f162bc2b126edaaf5f915b80","permalink":"https://raluca-san.github.io/publication/sandu-quantitative-2019-1/","publishdate":"2020-01-08T19:01:07.39748Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sandu-quantitative-2019-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Thermal ablations are becoming an increasingly common alternative treatment to surgery in patients with primary  and  secondary  hepatic  tumors.
