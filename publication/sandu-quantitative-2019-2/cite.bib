 abstract = {Thermal ablations are becoming an increasingly common alternative treatment to surgery in patients with 
hepatic tumors. In image-guided percutaneous ablations of liver tumors, the technical post-interventional 
success of ablation treatment is defined by achieving complete tumor destruction and an ablation margin of 
at least 5 mm. In the current setting, the ablation-tumor coverage is visually evaluated by an interventional 
radiologist. To address this limitation, we have developed a set of quantitative methods for evaluating the 
volumetric coverage of ablations. In this work, we present the quantitative ablation evaluation method and 
preliminary results after applying it to a retrospective cohort of 100 patients that were treated with image-
guided percutaneous ablations for colorectal liver metastases.},
