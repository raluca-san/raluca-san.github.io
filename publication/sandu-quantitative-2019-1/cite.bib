 abstract = {Thermal ablations are becoming an increasingly common alternative treatment to surgery in patients with primary 
and  secondary  hepatic  tumors.  In  image-guided  percutaneous  ablations  of  liver  tumors,  the  technical  post-
interventional success of ablation treatment is defined by achieving complete tumor destruction and an ablation 
margin of at least 5 mm. Therefore, it is crucial that proper ablation verification is ensured intra-operatively or 
immediately  post-operatively.  In  the  current  setting,  the  ablation-tumor  coverage  is  visually  evaluated  by  an 
interventional radiologist who compares the differences between the pre- and post-ablation images. To address 
this  limitation,  we  have developed an  image analysis  pipeline  consisting  of  a  set of  quantitative  methods  for 
evaluating the volumetric coverage of the ablation, which could be added to image-guidance systems. In this work, 
we present the quantitative ablation evaluation method and preliminary results after applying it to a retrospective 
cohort of 100 patients that were treated with image-guided percutaneous ablations for colorectal liver metastasis.},
