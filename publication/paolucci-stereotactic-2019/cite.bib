 abstract = {Stereotactic percutaneous ablation is a rapidly advancing modality for treatment 
of tumors in soft solid organs such as the liver. Each year, there are about 850,000 
cases of primary liver cancer worldwide. Although surgical resection still is the gold 
standard for most cases, only 20–30% of patients are candidates for it, due to the 
advanced stage of the disease. Surgery can also be a huge burden to the patient and 
his/her quality of life might be temporarily severely reduced due to long hospital 
stays, complications, and slow recovery. To overcome these disadvantages, thermo-
ablation of tumors of up to 3 cm has become a more viable alternative especially in the 
last decade, offering a potentially equally effective but minimally invasive and tissue 
sparing treatment alternative. In conjunction with improved CT imaging, stereotactic 
image-guidance techniques and image fusion technology were introduced to increase 
safety, efficacy, and accuracy of this treatment. Stereotactic image-guidance leads to a 
simple, fast, and accurate placement of the ablation probe into the liver tumor, which 
is a prerequisite for a complete destruction of the tumor by ablation. More and more 
physicians, including surgeons, consider ablation a viable alternative to resection 
whenever feasible. Patients undergoing such a minimally invasive treatment benefit 
from a shorter hospital stays, reduced complication rates, and faster recovery.},
