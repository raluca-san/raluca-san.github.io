 abstract = {In  image-guided  percutaneous  ablations  of  liver 
tumors, the technical intra-procedural success of the treatment 
is  defined  by  achieving  complete  tumor  destruction  plus  a 
circumferential ablation margin of at least 5 mm.  In the current 
setting,  the  ablation  success  is  visually  evaluated  by  an 
interventional  radiologist  who  compares  the  differences 
between  the  pre-  and  post-ablation  images.  To  address  this 
limitation, we have developed an image-based analysis pipeline 
to compute radiomics for evaluating the volumetric coverage of 
the ablation. In this work, we present preliminary results after 
applying  the  radiomics  extraction  pipeline  to  a  retrospective 
cohort  of  102  patients  that  were  treated  with  image-guided 
percutaneous  microwave  ablations  for  colorectal  liver 
metastases.},
